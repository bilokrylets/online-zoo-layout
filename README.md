# RSS Online-zoo

#### project implementation (https://bilokrylets.github.io/online-zoo-layout/pages/index.html)

This project is a responsive webpage built using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. It is based on a design provided in Figma, which I converted into a functional webpage.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The page adapts to different screen sizes using SCSS for styling.
- **Figma to Code**: The design was implemented by translating a Figma mockup into HTML and SCSS.
- **DOM Manipulation**: JavaScript is used to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM), enabling dynamic changes to the webpage.
- **Responsive Slider**: A fully responsive js image slider that adapts to various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup structure for the webpage.
- **SCSS (Sass)**: For styling and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: To handle interactions with the DOM.

## What I Learned

- **SCSS for Better CSS Management**: Using variables, mixins, and nesting helped make the styling more modular and easier to maintain.
- **DOM Manipulation with JavaScript**: I learned how to use JavaScript to dynamically update and interact with elements on the page.
- **Creating a Responsive Slider**: I built a responsive slider that adjusts to different screen sizes, improving the user experience on mobile and desktop devices.
